            <h2>Understanding Yeast and Fermentation</h2>
            <p>Yeast is a single-celled microorganism that ferments the sugar in bread dough, producing carbon dioxide (CO₂) and alcohol. Activated by warm water and sugar, the yeast feeds on the sugar in the dough and releases CO₂, which is trapped in the gluten network in the dough, increasing its volume and creating a light texture in the bread. Alcohol is produced during the fermentation process, and most of it evaporates during the baking process, leaving behind a characteristic flavor. Fermentation is most active at a temperature of about 35°C, but slows down at cold temperatures, and salt plays a role in regulating yeast activity to appropriately adjust the fermentation speed. In this way, yeast fermentation has a significant impact on the volume, texture, and taste of the dough, and the process is controlled by various factors such as temperature, sugar, pH, and salt.</p>

        <section id="gluten-development">
            <h2>The Role of Gluten</h2>
            <p>Gluten is a collection of proteins contained in wheat flour, and plays an important role in bread dough. When dough is mixed with water, gluten proteins absorb the water and bind together to form a flexible and elastic network. This network acts to capture carbon dioxide trapped in the dough, and the gas produced during yeast fermentation causes the dough to rise. Gluten is also essential for determining the structure and texture of bread, and well-fermented dough produces a soft and chewy texture. In addition, the strength and elasticity of gluten help maintain the desired texture and shape in various types of bread, which greatly affects the overall quality and taste of the bread.</p>

            <h2>Techniques & Tools</h2>
            <p>From kneading to proofing, understanding the basic techniques and tools used in bread baking is crucial for success. Below are some essential techniques along with their importance in the bread-making process.</p>

                    <h3>Kneading</h3>
                    <p>Kneading is the process of working the dough to develop gluten, which gives bread its structure and elasticity. This technique involves folding, pushing, and turning the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. Proper kneading is vital for achieving a good rise and texture in the final loaf.</p>

                <figcaption>
                    <h3>Proofing</h3>
                    <p>Proofing is the final rise of the dough before it goes into the oven. During this time, the yeast continues to produce carbon dioxide, causing the dough to expand and become airy. It’s important to let the dough proof until it has doubled in size, which usually takes about 1-2 hours, depending on the recipe and temperature.</p>

                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>Scoring involves making shallow cuts on the surface of the dough just before baking. This technique allows the bread to expand in a controlled manner as it bakes, preventing it from bursting unevenly. Scoring also creates a beautiful decorative pattern on the crust, enhancing the loaf’s presentation.</p>
